[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/urish/gulp-add-src.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/urish/gulp-add-src)

Installation
------------

`npm install gulp-add-src --save-dev`

Usage
-----
Works like `gulp.src`, but you can put it anywhere in your pipeline and it will append the given files
to the pipeline.

Example:
```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var addsrc = require('gulp-add-src');
var coffee = require('gulp-coffee');
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');

gulp.task('build', function () {
  return gulp.src('files/coffee/*.coffee')   // start with the .coffee files in the project
	.pipe(coffee())                          // compiles coffee script
	.pipe(addsrc('files/js/*.js'))           // we use addsrc to add our .js files to the mix
	.pipe(uglify())                          // we minify everything
	.pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));                // and write to dist
});
```
